# sudoku-solver
Fun little project in which I worked with ChatGPT to make a sudoku puzzle solver with a functional UI.

- Download the Sudoku.jar file and to run the mini sudoku app.
- You can load a default sudoku puzzle,
- Manually copy an existing puzzle you may be stumped on,
- Or you can just create your own puzzle from scratch.
- Press the solve button at any time to watch the puzzle solved recursively in real time.
